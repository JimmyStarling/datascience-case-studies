## DataScience Case Studies
This is a repository of Data Science case studies taken from coursers, talks, projects, ideas and etc. 
Fell free to send a PR :).

### How it works?
You'll need to have python3 installed on your machine.
Then execute this following command at your terminal 
`
python3 [filename.py]
`

## What would be great to implement
- [ ] Add examples with pytorch.
- [ ] Add examples with tensorflow.
- [ ] Add more sections, e.g, neural-network, and etc.
- [ ] Make feedbacks about studies.
